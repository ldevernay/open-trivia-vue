# Context

A simple quizz based on the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

# Instructions

- Fork the code, understand how it works.
- Add some functionalities :
  - Get 10 questions from the API instead of 5,
  - Modify the scoring as follows :
    - each right answer to a true/false question earns you 1 point,
    - each right answer to a regular question earns you 2 points.
  - Let the user choose a category (or no category for truly random questions),
  - Let the user select a Difficulty (Medium doubles the score, Hard triples it),
  - Implement a restart button to allow the user to restart whenever he wants and keep his score.
  - Add a hi-scores list.
